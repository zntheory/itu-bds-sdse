# Stuff to install

We will be using **Visual Studio Code** (VSCode) as our editor, and we will be **using the terminal to run our code**. We also need **Go** (obviously—it is part of the course) and extensions for VSCode to make our lives easier.

Later on we will be using **Git**, **Docker** and **Dagger**, but install instructions for those follow in later sections and are not necessary for now.

You may know what Git is about, but Docker and Dagger are probably new to you. Don't worry, we will cover them in later lessons.

> **Important:** If you are running Windows, you _will_ need to install WSL2. The development stack has certain requirements and a *nix environment (MacOS/Linux) is one of them.

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

## What you need to install

- **Visual Studio Code** (latest version, 1.103.2)
- **Go** (latest version, 1.25.0)
- **Git** (latest version, 2.51.0)
- **Docker Engine** (latest version, 28.4.0), can be installed with **Docker Desktop** (latest version, 4.45.0)
- **Dagger** (latest version, 0.18.17)

Versions are as of writing this course (September 2025).

> **Note:** Other Visual Studio Code based IDEs, such as **Cursor** or **Windsurf**, can be used as well, but you cannot expect support from TAs if you use them instead. The only caveats are that the IDEs are version wise behind VSCode and extensions are only available in older versions.

Using Homebrew for package management is recommended. You can install Homebrew by following the instructions [here](https://brew.sh/). Homebrew only works on MacOS and most Linux distributions.

> **Note:** If you are running on Windows, using **WSL2** is recommended. You can install it by following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Ubuntu is recommended as the Linux distribution.

## Visual Studio Code

- Install VSCode from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

## Go

1. Install Go from [here](https://golang.org/dl/) or if you are using Homebrew, run `brew install go`.

2. Install the following [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go) in VSCode:
![Extensions](../../images/lessons/golang-introduction/vscode-go-extension.png)
This will install several tool integrations in VSCode and most importantly the Go LSP.</br></br>
Install the most recent version. Currently it is **v0.48.0**.

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

## Git

- Install Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or if you are using Homebrew, run `brew install git`.

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

> WSL = Windows Subsystem for Linux</br>
> LSP = Language Server Protocol

## <i class="fa-solid fa-rocket"></i> Let's see if it works <i class="fa-solid fa-rocket"></i>

</br>
</br>

**Go Test**

Hello World in Go!

Don't worry about the code for now. You will get to understand it when we go through the fundamentals.

Create a new file called `main.go`:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

</br>
</br>

Run:

```bash
go run main.go
```

</br>
</br>

You should see something that is not an error >D

</br>
</br>

**Git Test**

Let's verify Git is working properly:

```bash
git version
```

You should see the Git version number displayed.

</br>
</br>

</br>
</br>

**Docker Test**

Let's check if Docker Engine is running:

```bash
docker --version
```

You should see the Docker version information.

> **Note:** If it says Docker is not running, you may need to start Docker Desktop.

</br>
</br>

Run a simple container:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

You should see a "Hello from Docker!" message confirming Docker is working correctly—like this:

```text
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (arm64v8)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:

**Dagger Test**

Verify Dagger installation:

```bash
dagger version
```

You should see the Dagger version number.

</br>
</br>

> **Note:** If any of these tests fail, double-check your installation steps and ensure all tools are properly installed and configured. Ask the TAs for help.
